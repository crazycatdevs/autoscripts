For this to work, you'll need your bots to be: linked in a botnet, running this script, added via .+bot nick address, the nickname should match the botnet-nick, have a unique the hostmask on IRC, and have a global or channel +o flag on all bots. The security of this relies on the fact that the bot which wants to have ops must be 1) linked to the current botnet (which requires a password), 2) have an entry with +o on the bot that he wants ops from and 3) must match the hostmask that is stored on each bots userfile (so it is good to keep the hostmasks up-to-date)","config":{"loaded":1,"requires":null,"vars":{"go_bot_unknown":{"description":"Log when an unknown (unauthorized) bot sends a request to your bot","value":1},"go_bot_unban":{"description":"Request to be unbanned it the Eggdrop is banned","value":1},"go_cycle":{"description":"Alert the channel if there are no ops","value":5},"go_cycle_msg":{"description":"Message used to alert channel there are no ops","value":"Please part this channel so the bots can cycle!"}}}}
