	"long_description": "The game starts when the bot generates a string of letters (the ACRO), from which players must try to make a meaningful phrase. For example if the ACRO generated is \u0022MTAGR\u0022, a meaningful phrase could be \u0022man this acro game rocks\u0022. Players are given a limited period in which to submit a phrase, whereafter the bot will read all the submissions, and players will have the opportuniy to vote for the phrase they think is best. A player receives 1 point for every vote his/her phrase receives. After the voting time expires, the bot read the scores and the next round begins. After a pre-determined number of rounds the game ends and the total score for each player is tallied.",
